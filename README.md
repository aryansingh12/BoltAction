## Inspiration
I lot of people like me are left out from the courts or the fields because we are not professionals but want to play.
We see 2 major cases, either no one in the field, or the field is already full and teams have been divided.

## What it does
It tells you the various games scheduled in various fields.
You can join a sport in a field, if it is under the capacity

## How I built it
Built in Android studio and integrated with Firebase realtime, Algolia search, and Twilio's APIs

## Challenges I ran into
It was tough getting the firebase working, as it was my first time with real time.
The APIs offered different services rather than products or data, which made it interesting and tough at the same time

## What I learned
Basics of APIs like twilio, clarifai, algolia along with how to integrate with the firebase realtime database .

## What's next for BoltAction
Connecting with nearby grounds and fields for better integration.
Integrating twilio more for messaging with friends and chatbot.
Add grounds or working paces and then Challenge your friends. 
Integrating Firebase more so that every sport event can become real time.
We can organize tournament for people who want to play during the weekends.
